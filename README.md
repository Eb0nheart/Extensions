# Extensions

## Intro
This is a library which contains extensions for anything. As of now, these are mostly conversions, f.ex. to convert between units like kg and lb. 
Should you need an extension for something, or have an idea for one, feel free to extend the repo with more extensions. There are some requirements though, so make sure to read and follow them before you start developing. Other than that, **GLHF!**

## Requirements

1. Use [Scaled Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/). (basically gitflow, use feature and pull requests).
2. Test driven development. I will check this in your commit history so make sure you do it!!
